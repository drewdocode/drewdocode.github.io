Software Developer by trade, I specialize in front and back end development in the Java and JavaScript ecosystems. I have nearly fifteen years of cross-industry experience, and I work mostly in Northern VA and DC.

I am also a Career Coach and Software Development mentor for Jr. Software Developers and new college grads considering a future in the industry.

Along with my day job, I am passionate about social entrepreneurship for the benefit of the underprivileged, and about using software development to that end.

Fascination with technology and innovation, particularly anything VR, AR, AI, and IoT, feeds the low key sci-fi anime video game head in me. I am also into minimalist design and photography.

A good work day would start with the daily stand up led by Tracy Morgan, a design cipha with Dr. Boyce Watkins, Mutabaruka, Jay Electronica and Elon Musk, and end with coding alongside Robert Martin and Jerry Lawson.
